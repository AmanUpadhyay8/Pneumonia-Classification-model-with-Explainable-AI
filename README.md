## Chest X-ray Classification with Explainable AI

This document outlines a codebase designed for classifying chest X-rays (distinguishing pneumonia from normal cases) and providing insights into the model's decisions using Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, particularly Integrated Gradients.

### Techniques Used:

#### Image Preprocessing:
- **Resizing:** All images are resized to a standardized dimension.
- **Data Splitting:** The dataset is divided into training, validation, and testing subsets for robust model evaluation.
- **Normalization:** Pixel values are normalized, depending on the model's requirements.
- **Data Augmentation:** Optional augmentation techniques are applied to generate synthetic images, enhancing the model's generalization capability.

#### Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):
- A widely used deep learning architecture for image classification tasks.
- The CNN extracts features from input images through multiple convolutional layers.
- These features are then used for classifying the images into pneumonia or normal categories.

#### Integrated Gradients:
- An XAI technique used to interpret model predictions.
- Calculates the gradient of the output concerning the input features, tracing a path from a baseline (usually zero) to the actual input.
- Highlights the most influential input features contributing to the model's prediction.

#### LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations):
- A model-agnostic technique to interpret predictions of any model.
- Generates a simplified explanation around a specific prediction by fitting an interpretable model (e.g., decision tree) locally to the data point.
- Offers insights into the most influential features for a particular prediction.

### Importance of Explainable AI (XAI):

XAI is crucial for enhancing the trustworthiness and interpretability of machine learning models:
- **Gain insights:** Understand the significant features influencing the model's decisions.
- **Identify bias:** Detect and address potential biases in the model's predictions.
- **Debug and improve models:** Diagnose issues and enhance model performance.
- **Build trust:** Foster trust in AI systems by providing transparent explanations for their behavior.

### Readme Structure:
